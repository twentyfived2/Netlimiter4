# [ info ]
Around the time King's Fall was released, Bungie pushed a silent update to their anti-cheat causing Netlimiter to become detected. However, with very little work on the software
it can be made undetectable again. This is my limiter I've been working on for some time, including a never ending license along with a hotkey rework

If this ever becomes detected again, I will do some more work with it and find a workaround, until then there is very little to add or change.

## [Notes]

1. If your antivirus flags this as a virus it is a false positive. It happens because of the randomised strings.
2. Don't limit in pvp. It will get you banned very fast
3. Be cautious limiting in public lfg lobbies. Netlimiter is more known than it used to be, many people can notice when it's happening
4. Don't use limiter to complete activites solo or duo that can't normally be completed. It's a fairly common giveaway to bungie that you've been limiting
